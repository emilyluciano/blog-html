    <p> Hey everyone! Im emily and my sister Megan, my twin are starting a blog that will have lots of fashion, beauty and hair tutorials. Just a little about myself, I love fashion and I am studying graphic design! I love anything that will bring out a chic and preppy look. I love instagramming my outfits of the week and love sharing my look and how how I put it all together and where I bought the items! I hope you all enjoy our blog! </p></p>

    <p> Hey! Just like emily said, i love fashion and wearing big loose braids in my hair. I love trying on new styles and creating outfits that everyone will want to look at. I have long hair so I will do fun hair styles for you all to do as well! Some days Emily will show you the look and other days it will be myself. Enjoy!</p>
